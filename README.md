# Customer-Segmentation-using-K-mean-Clustering
## Project Overview
This project involves using K-means clustering to segment customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing behaviors. Customer segmentation allows businesses to target specific groups with tailored marketing strategies, improving customer satisfaction and increasing sales.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains customer data, which includes various features such as age, income, spending score, and more. These features are used to cluster customers into different segments.

## Project Steps
### 1. Data Preprocessing
Loading the Dataset: The dataset is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): EDA is performed to understand the distribution of the data, check for missing values, and visualize the features.

### 2. K-means Clustering
Choosing the Number of Clusters: The optimal number of clusters is determined using the Elbow Method.

Model Construction: A K-means clustering model is constructed using the scikit-learn library.

Model Training: The model is trained on the dataset to identify distinct customer segments.

### 3. Results and Analysis
Cluster Visualization: The clusters are visualized to understand the characteristics of each segment.

Cluster Interpretation: Each cluster is analyzed to identify common traits among the customers in that segment.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of K-means clustering for customer segmentation. By identifying distinct customer segments, businesses can tailor their marketing strategies to better meet the needs of each group, ultimately enhancing customer satisfaction and driving sales growth.
